# Welcome to the Shopping Application

## In the client you need to install :

The framework that i'm using is Vite with React using JavaScript :  

``npm create vite@latest``  

``npm i axios react-hot-toast react-router-dom``  

## If the node_modules are not in the server directory you need to install :  

``npm i bcrypt cookie-parser cors dotenv express jsonwebtoken mongoose nodemon``

### To proper run the project you need to :

- In the client directory :
      ``npm run dev``
- In the server directory :
      ``npm start``

In the package.json on the ./server you should integrate : 
``start "nodemon index.js"`` (take a look to the screenshot)
